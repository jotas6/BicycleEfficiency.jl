    abstract = "{Chain drive efficiency has been studied to understand energy loss mechanisms in bicycle drive trains, primarily for derailleur-type systems. An analytical study of frictional energy loss mechanisms for chain drives is given along with a series of experimental measurements of chain drive efficiency under a range of power, speed and lubrication conditions. Measurements of mechanical efficiency are compared to infrared measurements indicating that frictional losses cannot account for the observed variations in efficiency. The results of this study indicate that chain tension and sprocket size primarily affect efficiency and that non-thermal loss mechanisms dominate overall chain drive efficiency.}",

ABSTRACT = {In the present study, a novel approach to estimating the efficiency of roller chain power transmission systems is proposed based on sliding friction losses and damping force. The dynamics model is taken into account between chain links with lateral offset owing to the derailleur system. Frictional losses were calculated according to Coulomb&rsquo;s law of friction, and the damping force was dependent on the damping coefficient. The effects of rotational speed, load, derailleur system, and damping coefficient on transmission efficiency were analyzed. The test stand of the roller chain power transmission system was set up to verify the estimated efficiency, and the results showed a good correlation, demonstrating the validity of the chain power transmission efficiency estimation.},
