# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Road cycling is one of the most practiced and renowed sports in the world.
As with practically any other modern sport, developing better equipment and
improving the athelete's performance through science and engineering has
become a major focus for professional and amateur riders alike.

One of such efforts is the design of optimal race strategies. This field of
research revolves around developing mathematical models to simulate a cyclist's
performance under different race conditions, which can then be analysed in order
to identify the strategy that minmizes race time for a given track. Typically, these
models aim to quantify power losses due to resistive forces such as aerodynamic drag,
and to find their relationship with controllable parameters such as bicycle configuration,
cyclist posture and power output. Examples of this type of work can be found in
[@angulomunoz; @roa; @almario; @polancoposture].

One of such sources of power loss is related
to the efficiency of the bicycle's power transmission system. When developing
models for race strategy optimization, it is a common practice to consider the
chain drive's efficiency as a constant parameter obtained from direct measurements
or from the literature [@angulomunoz; @roa; @almario; @polancoposture].
This approach is both useful and practical, but has limited interpretability in
relation to the power transmission's system design and configuration. Hence, there
exists an opportunity to improve race strategy optimization effort by developing
models for the bycicle's chain drive system efficiency.

The purpose of this work is to examine currently available models as well as
implement them computationally, in order to analyse their implications and
shortcomings. Finally, a new model is proposed through the integration and
adjustment of the different models found in the literature. The computational
implementation was carried out using the Julia programming language, and its
results can be found in the package [`BicycleEfficiency.jl`](https://github.com/jotas6/BicycleEfficiency.jl).
All calculations have been performed using this package and the code used to
generate the figures found in this work has been included in order to facilitate
reproducibility. The package's [documentation](https://jotas6.github.io/BicycleEfficiency.jl/dev/)
contains instructions and information regarding its use and installation.

# Frictional losses {#sec-frictional-losses}

Frictional work has been identified as one of the sources of energy loss in
power transmission systems involving roller chains, such as the ones commonly
found in road bicycles [@SpicerFriction; @EffEstimation]. Owing to the importance of this type of mechanisms
in industrial settings, there has been extensive work related to the modeling of
frictional losses. However, it has been noted that a bicyle's power transmission
system differs significantly from those found in the industry due to its unique
operating conditions, which include exposure to exteriors and chain misalignment
[@SpicerFriction; @kidd]. Thus, when modeling frictional losses on a bicycle's chain drive,
only the models developed specifically for the derailleur-type systems found
on road bicycles should be considered.

One of the earliest records of such efforts is found in the work of Spicer,
Richardson, Ehrlich, Bernstein, Fukuda and Terada @SpicerFriction. Their work
seeked to study the effect of frictional losses on the efficiency of a bicycle's
chain drive system and among their results is found an analytical model that
allows the calculation of the efficiency for a variety of operating conditions and
bicycle configurations, considering only power losses due to frictional work.

## Analytical model {#sec-frictional-losses-model}

The model developed in @SpicerFriction considered three sources of power loss: friction between
inner link bushing and chain pin, chain line offset and contact between sprocket
tooth, link roller and inner link bushing, and used the results obtained from
the dynamic analysis performed on @kidd to calculate chain tension, average
tooth pressure angle and articulation angles.

Given that the purpose of this work is to analyse and implement the models computationally, a detailed description
on how the model was developed will not be included. The reader is referred to the original source
@SpicerFriction for additional details and a more complete treatment on the development of the model.

### Source 1: friction between inner link bushing and chain pin

As the name suggests, the first source of power loss comes from the relative motion that exists between
chain pins and inner link bushing during chain articulation with the front and rear sprockets. It can be
shown that power losses from this source can be calculated using the following expression.

$$ P_{1} = \frac{\pi}{2}T_{0}N_{1}\omega_{1}\mu\rho(N_{1}^{-1} + N_{2}^{-1}) $$

Where $T_{0}$ is chain tension, $N_{1}$ is the number of teeth on the front sprocket, $\omega_{1}$ corresponds
to pedaling cadence, $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction betweeen the pin and the bushing, $\rho$ is the chain
pin radius and $N_{2}$ is the number of teeth on the rear sprocket.

### Source 2: chain line offset

As it was stated before, one of the unique features of a bicycle's chain drive is that the chain is misaligned most
of the time due to the fact that it must accomodate different front and rear sprocket configurations. This implies that
sprocket teeth slide against the inner part of the chain plates, which generates friction. Power losses through this
mechanism are calculated as follows.

$$ P_{2} = N_{1}\omega_{1}\mu T_{0}r_{0}\sin(\gamma)(N_{1}^{-1} + N_{2}^{-1}) $$

Two new variables have been introduced: $r_{0}$, which corresponds to the depth of sprocket teeth, and $\gamma$, which is the chain
misalignment angle.

The reader will note that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are very similar. However, it should be noted that chain misalignment angle ($\gamma$) is
typically very small, being approximately between 1 and 4 degrees [@kidd; @SpicerFriction]. This means that $\sin(\gamma)$
will also be very small, and thus frictional losses from this source are almost negligible. This will be further explored in subsequent sections and
can be visualized in @fig-power-share.

### Source 3: sprocket tooth, link roller and inner link bushing

This source of power loss is related to the articulation and departure of the chain to the sprockets. In particular, it is noted that
the chain's roller must rotate and slide in order to settle in its final position at the root of the sprocket. This motion generates
friction between the roller and the bushing (roller rotates) and between the roller and the sprocket tooth (roller slides). Power losses
due to this interaction can be modeled by the following equation.

$$ P_{3} = \frac{\mu T_{0}r_{R}N_{1}\omega_{1}}{4\pi}A\sum_{i = 1}^{2}
        [\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}}\cos(\phi_{i}) - \sin(\phi_{i})\ln(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}}) + \sin(\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}})\cot(\phi_{i}))] $$

Where the parameter $A$ has the following definition

$$ A = \frac{\delta\psi}{\pi - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^{2}{N_{i}} $$

This equations have introduced new variables, such as $r_{R}$, which is the chain roller radius. Other variables, such as $\phi$ and $\delta$ can be related
to known parameters. In particular, @kidd presents the following relation to calculate $\phi$.

$$ \phi_{i} = 35 - \frac{120}{N_{i}} $$

It should the noted that the formula given for $\phi$ produces the angle in degrees. On the other hand, $\delta$ can be calculated with the following
expression, given by @SpicerFriction.

$$ \delta = \psi r_{R} $$

Where $\psi$ is defined as the absolute roller rotation angle, which can be approximated as a constant parameter with a value of $\pi/2$.

### Total power loss and efficiency

Total power loss can be determined through the sum of power losses from sources 1, 2 and 3.

$$ P_{total} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} $$

Using this result, it is possible to determine the efficiency of the power transmission system, assuming that all power losses come from friction.

$$ \eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_{in} - P_{total}}{P_{in}} = 1 - \frac{P_{total}}{P_{in}} $$

## Model analysis {#sec-frictional-losses-analysis}

Using the model, it is possible to calculate not only the efficiency of the system,
but also the magnitude power losses. This  leads to one of the
most interesting facts that can be derived from the model: power loss due to friction
between inner link bushing and chain pin (source 1) is by far the most significant out of three
sources of power loss considered in the model. Calculation over a range of commonly found
operating conditions and sprocket configurations show that it typically accounts for approximately
90% of total power losses. As an example, @fig-power-share shows the results obtained for
a pedaling cadence of 80 rpm and a front-rear sprocket size relation of 50:21. It should
be noted that parameters such as the friction coefficient, chain pitch and others needed
for the calculation were partially taken from @SpicerFriction and are listed in appendix A.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-power-share
#| fig-cap: "Power loss share"

ω = 80*(2π/60)
N = [50, 21]

P1_80 = P1(μ, ρ, N, ω, T0)
P2_80 = P2(N, ω, μ, rR, γ, T0)
P3_80 = P3(μ, rR, N, ω, ψ, T0)

bar([P1_80, P2_80, P3_80], label=false, xlabel="Source",
    ylabel="Power [W]", xticks = [1, 2, 3], fillcolor = :lavender)
```
As it was stated before, @fig-power-share shows that source 1 dominates overall power
losses. For the particular case considered in @fig-power-share, friction between inner link
bushing and chain pin accounts for 91.3% of power losses.

Another interesting aspect to explore through the model is the influence of sprocket size and pedaling
cadence on power loss. @fig-power-sprocket-cadence shows power loss for various
front and rear sprocket configurations as a function of pedaling cadence.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-power-sprocket-cadence
#| fig-cap: "Power loss as a function of pedaling cadence for various sprocket configurations"

ω_rpm = 50:100
ω_rad = ω_rpm*(2*pi/60)
N1loss = [48, 52]
N2loss = [11, 34]

Ploss = [Ptotal(fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [i1, i2], j, γ, T0)
         for i1 in N1loss for i2 in N2loss for j in ω_rad]

shape = (length(ω_rad), length(N1loss) + length(N2loss))

labels = reshape(["$(i):$(j)" for i in N1loss for j in N2loss],
                (1, length(N1loss) + length(N2loss)))

plot(ω_rpm, reshape(Ploss, shape), xlabel="Pedaling cadence [rpm]",
     ylabel="Power loss [W]", labels = labels, legend = :topleft)
```

@fig-power-sprocket-cadence shows that power loss increases linearly with pedaling
cadence, and that increasing front sprocket size increases power losses, but
increasing rear sprocket size has the oppposite effect. Another important
conclusion that can be drawn from @fig-power-sprocket-cadence is that changes on
rear sprocket size have a much more significant impact than changes on front sprocket
size. This last behaviour is also exhibited when considering efficiency instead of
power losses. @fig-efficiency-sprockets shows the efficiency for different front and rear
sprocket sizes, at 80 rpm.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-efficiency-sprockets
#| fig-cap: "Influence of sprocket size on efficiency"

N1_plot = [48, 50, 52]
N2_plot = [11, 21, 34]

η_plot = []
for i in N1_plot
	for j in N2_plot
		push!(η_plot, η(fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [i, j], ω, γ, T0)*100)
	end
end

bar(Float64.(η_plot), xlabel="Sprocket sizes", ylabel="Efficiency [%]",
    label=false, fillcolor=:lavender)
xticks!(1:9, ["$(i):$(j)" for i in N1_plot for j in N2_plot])
ylims!(97, 100)
```
@fig-efficiency-sprockets shows that changes on front sprocket size have a marginal
effect on efficiency, but changes on rear sprocket size can have more significant effects
on efficiency. This effect is more evident in @fig-efficiency-rear, where it can be seen that
increasing rear sprocket size from 11 teeth to 34 teeth can carry along an increase of 0.7% in
efficiency. This result agrees with what was shown in @fig-power-sprocket-cadence, which illustrates that power losses
are reduced when the rear sprocket size is increased. @fig-efficiency-rear explores this relationship in
further detail, by presenting the calculation of efficiencies for various rear sprocket sizes, keeping
the front sprocket size constant at 50 teeth and pedaling cadence at 80 rpm.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-efficiency-rear
#| fig-cap: "Rear sprocket size effect on efficiency (front sprocket size of 50 teeth)"

N2_ef_rear = [11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 34]
η_rear = [η(fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [50, i], ω, γ, T0)*100
            for i in N2_ef_rear]

bar(η_rear, label=false, xlabel="Rear sprocket size", ylabel="Efficiency [%]",
    fillcolor=:lavender, xticks=(1:length(N2_ef_rear), N2_ef_rear))
ylims!(97, 100)
```

## Model validation {#sec-frictional-losses-validation}

In addition to the model described above, @SpicerFriction includes efficiency measurements under
various operating conditions. This is used to contrast the behaviour predicted by the model with experimental
results and to check the accuracy of power loss estimates. @tbl-friction-validation shows estimated efficiencies
and their experimental counterparts for different pedaling speeds, at a fixed power input of
100 W and a sprocket relation of 52:21.

| Pedaling cadence [rpm] | Measured efficiency [%] | Calculated efficiency [%] | Error [%] |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------------:|:---------:|
| 40 | 97.8 | 99.4 | 1.6 |
| 50 | 95.9 | 99.4 | 3.6 |
| 60 | 94.4 | 99.4 | 5.3 |
| 70 | 92.8 | 99.4 | 7.1 |
| 80 | 91.3 | 99.4 | 8.9 |
| 90 | 89.9 | 99.4 | 10.6 |
: Frictional losses model validation {#tbl-friction-validation}

@tbl-friction-validation shows that calculated efficiencies differ from those obtained through
experimental measurements. In particular, it can be seen that the model predicts higher efficiencies
than observed and that it doesn't account for variations in pedaling cadence, which seem to significantly affect efficiency.

On the other hand, the model discussed above presents a series of shortcomings related to chain tension. One of them is
the fact that chain tension is modeled as a constant parameter that is independent of operating conditions and bicycle
configuration. Examination of the literature regarding chain drive systems, such as @chains, reveal that this assumption
does not hold true, and that chain tension has a strong dependence on parameters such as power input and pedaling cadence.
The following section will focus on this issue.

Another issue that can be found in the model is the fact that it only accounts for losses on the rear and front sprocket,
which is not completely accurate, since a road's bicycle derailleur unit involves the presence of two additional sprockets.
The effect of the presence of this mechanism is expected to increase power losses and will be explored in subsequent sections.

# Chain tension {#sec-chain-tension}

The models discussed previously all consider chain tension as a fixed parameter that might be related to bicycle configuration and
operating conditions, but no expressions are given to calculate its value or understand its relationship with other parameters.
A review of the literature regarding chain drive systems shows that chain tension can be related to chain and sprocket geometry
(bicycle configuration) and to operating conditions such as power input @chains. This section presents a model developed to estimate chain tension
as a function of current operating conditions, in an effort to increase model accuracy and reduce the number of assumptions and parameters
needed to calculate efficiency.

First, it should be noted that chain tension comes from two sources mainly: centrifugal force and the forces
exerted by the sprockets to the chain @chains. @fig-tension-diagram shows the chain (represented as small circles)
and the front sprocket (big circle) and the variables involved in the calculation of chain tension due to sprocket
forces.

![Chain tension due to force exerted by the sprockets](fig_tension.pdf){#fig-tension-diagram}

Following the notation used in @fig-tension-diagram, $T$ corresponds to chain tension, $\omega_{1}$ is pedaling
cadence, $R_{1}$ is the pitch radius of the front sprocket, $l_{c}$ is the length of the crank and $F_{c}$
is the force applied to the crank by the cyclist during pedaling.

@fig-tension-diagram shows that the force applied to the crank by the pedalist generates torque on the front sprocket, which is given
by the following expression.

$$ \tau = l_{c}F_{c}  $$

This torque is transmitted to the front sprocket, which then exerts a force to the chain through its teeth. This force is perceived
by the chain as tension and can be calculated using the torque on the front sprocket and it's pitch radius.

$$ T = \frac{\tau}{R_{1}} = \frac{l_{c}F_{c}}{R_{1}} $$

Crank length and the force exerted by the cyclist to the pedals are not commonly known. Thus, it is more useful to express this result
in terms of power input and pedaling cadence, which are much more commonly estimated and used by cyclists in pacing strategies. Observing
that power input can be calculated as torque times pedaling cadence, the following results are obtained.

$$ P_{in} = l_{c}F_{c}\omega_{1} $$

$$ \frac{P_{in}}{\omega_{1}} = l_{c}F_{c} $$

Substituting this expression on the formula for chain tension ($T$) yields the following relationship.

$$ T = \frac{P_{in}}{R_{1}\omega_{1}} $$

The front sprocket's pitch diameter can be calculated using the following formula.

$$ PD = \frac{p}{\sin(\pi/N_{1})} $$

Where $p$ corresponds to the chain pitch. Noting that $\pi << N_{1}$ for commonly found front sprocket sizes cycling, and that
pitch radius is one half of the pitch diameter, the following expression is obtained for the pitch radius.

$$ R_{1} = \frac{pN_{1}}{2\pi} $$

This result allows the following formulation for chain tension due to the force exerted by the sprocket.

$$ T = \frac{2\pi P_{in}}{\omega_{1}pN_{1}} $$

The other component of chain tension, which is caused by centrifugal force, can be calculated using the following expression @chains.

$$ T_{c} = mv^2 $$

Where $m$ is the linear density of the chain (mass per unit length) and $v$ is its velocity, which can be calculated from pedaling
cadence and sprocket pitch radius as $\omega_{1}R_{1}$. Substituting this expression for $v$ and using the result obtained above of
$R_{1}$, tension due to centrifugal forces can be calculated as follows.

$$ T_{c} = \frac{m(\omega_{1}pN_{1})^2}{4\pi^{2}} $$

Lastly, total chain tension can be determined by the sum of the tension due to the force exerted by the sprockets and the tension due to
centrifigual forces. This produces the following result.

$$ T_{0} = \frac{2\pi P_{in}}{\omega_{1}pN_{1}} + \frac{m(\omega_{1}pN_{1})^2}{4\pi^{2}} $$

This result shows that chain tension is a dynamic parameter that depends on riding conditions such as power input and pedaling cadence,
and that it also depends on parameters related to the bicycle's geometry and configuration, such as front sprocket size and chain pitch.
This equation can be used to calculate chain tension in the models described above, instead of passing it as a constant parameter, which
should allow to produce more accurate predictions and model behaviour.

Lastly, @fig-tension-cadence shows chain tension as a function of power input, for a fixed pedaling cadence of 80 rpm and
a range of front sprocket sizes.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-tension-cadence
#| fig-cap: "Chain tension as a function of power input for a pedaling cadence of 80 rpm"

N = 46:2:52
P_plot = 100:350

Tplot = [T(i, ω, p, j, m) for j in N for i in P_plot]

plot(P_plot, reshape(Tplot, (length(P_plot), length(N))),
     xlabel="Power input [W]", ylabel="Chain tension [N]",
     label=reshape(N, (1,length(N))), legend=:topleft)
```
@fig-tension-cadence shows that chain tension in is the range of 100 to 450 N for common cycling conditions,
which is in agreement to the values presented in @SpicerFriction. Moreover, it shows that tension increases
linearly with power input for a given pedaling cadence, which is to be expected, since increasing power input
at a fixed pedaling cadence implies that a greater force is being applied to the pedals. Finally, it can also
be seen that chain tension increases when front sprocket size decreases.

# Chain tensioner

One of the unique characteristics of a road bicycle's chain drive system is the presence of a mechanism known as the
chain tensioner. Given the fact that bicycles are equipped with multiple sprocket configurations ranging a wide variety
of sizes, it is necessary to have a mechanism that ensures that the chain won't be too tensioned when the current configuration
involves high sprocket sizes, and that it won't become slack when sprockets sizes are low. This mechanism is part of the
derrailleur unit, and usually involves the addition of two small sprockets under the rear sprocket. These two sprockets
are attached to a mechanical arm which can move away or towards the front sprocket, and thus modify the distance that must
be accommodated by the chain (for a fixed chain length, chain tension increases as the distance covered by the chain increases).

Since frictional losses are associated with the engaging and departure of the chain from the sprockets, the addition of two
extra sprockets through the chain tensioner should increase power losses and decrease overall system efficiency. These effects
become particularly important when considering that the sprockets in chain tensioners are typically small, which creates high
articulation angles and increases frictional work between inner link bushing and chain pins (source 1 in frictional losses section).
As it was previously shown in @fig-power-share, source 1 dominates overall power losses, so including the effect from the chain tensioner's
sprockets should have a significant effect on efficiency calculations. Also, it was shown in @tbl-friction-validation that calculated
efficiencies are higher than their measured counterparts, so including the contributions from these sprockets should increase model accuracy.

Modifiying the equation for source one can be done by adding the contributions of the sprockets in the tensioner. This results in the following
expression.

$$ P_{1} = \frac{\pi}{2}T_{0}N_{1}\omega_{1}\mu\rho\sum_{i = 1}^{4} \frac{1}{N_{i}} $$

It should be noted that the expression $(N_{1}^{-1} + N_{2}^{-1})$ has been replaced by a summation. This expression would be identical to the one
reported above if the summation went up to $N_{2}$, however, the two extra terms added ($N_{3}$ and $N_{4}$) take into account the size of the sprockets
in the tensioner.

Even though frictional losses are mostly due to source 1, equations for sources 2 and 3 can also be adjusted to include the effects of the tensioner.
Noting that the expressions for sources 1 and 2 are very similar, the adjustment for source 2 also consists in adding the contribution of each sprocket.

$$ P_{2} = N_{1}\omega_{1}\mu T_{0}r_{0}\sin(\gamma)\sum_{i = 1}^{4} \frac{1}{N_{i}}$$

Lastly, frictional losses associated to source 3 can also be adjusted to include the effects of the chain tensioner. The resulting expression has the
following form.

$$ P_{3} = \frac{\mu T_{0}r_{R}N_{1}\omega_{1}}{4\pi}A\sum_{i = 1}^{4}
        [\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}}\cos(\phi_{i}) - \sin(\phi_{i})\ln(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}}) + \sin(\frac{2\pi}{N_{i}})\cot(\phi_{i}))] $$

This time, the parameter A has the following definition.

$$ A = \frac{\delta\psi}{\pi - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^{4}{N_{i}} $$

# Frictional losses revisited

The results obtained for chain tension as a function of operating conditions and the adjustments made to include the effect of the
chain tensioner on the model for frictional losses will be incorporated to generate a new analysis of frictional losses. In order to
study the effect of these modifications, the analysis made for the original model (presented above) will be replicated.

First, power loss share will be evaluated to determine if changes made to the model altered the distribution of power losses among the
3 sources considered. @fig-power-share-2 shows the results for identical operating conditions as @fig-power-share. In both cases, power input
was considered to be 250 W.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-power-share-2
#| fig-cap: "Power loss share with adjusted model"

N = [50, 21, 12, 12]

P1_80 = P1T(Pin, μ, ρ, N, ω, m, p)
P2_80 = P2T(Pin, N, ω, μ, rR, γ, m, p)
P3_80 = P3T(Pin, μ, rR, N, ω, ψ, m, p)

bar([P1_80, P2_80, P3_80], label=false, xlabel="Source",
    ylabel="Power [W]", xticks=[1, 2, 3], fillcolor=:lavender)
```

In this case, source 1 accounts for 88.3% of total power losses, which is slightly less than
the value obtained for the original model. However, it can still be seen that power total power
loss comes mostly from source 1.

Another aspect that is interesting to evaluate is the dependence of power losses on sprocket configuration
and pedaling cadence. This was done in @fig-power-sprocket-cadence for the original model, and
@fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2 shows the results obtained for the new model, under the same operating
conditions.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2
#| fig-cap: "Power loss as a function of pedaling cadence for various sprocket configurations, adjusted model"

Ploss = [PtotalT(Pin, fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [i1, i2, 12, 12], j, γ, m)
         for i1 in N1loss for i2 in N2loss for j in ω_rad]

plot(ω_rpm, reshape(Ploss, shape), xlabel="Pedaling cadence [rpm]",
     ylabel="Power loss [W]", labels=labels, legend=:topleft)
```

@fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2 shows that the adjustments have introduced a change on the model's behaviour. In particular, it
can be observed that power losses are now virtually constant with respect to pedaling cadence. This can be explained
by the fact that it was shown that chain tension is mainly due to the force exerted by the sprocket teeth to the chain (the contribution of
centrifgual forces is abour 1%), which is inversely proportional to pedaling cadence. A closer examination of the curves
presented in @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2 reveals that power losses are not constant with respect to pedaling cadence,
since the term related to centrifugal forces is proportional to the second power of pedaling candece. @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-3
shows total power losses only for the 48:34 sprocket relation.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-power-sprocket-cadence-3
#| fig-cap: "Power loss as a function of pedaling cadence for a sprocket relation of 48:34, adjusted model"

Ploss = [PtotalT(Pin, fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [48, 34, 12, 12], i, γ, m)
         for i in ω_rad]

plot(ω_rpm, Ploss, xlabel="Pedaling cadence [rpm]",
     ylabel="Power loss [W]", label=false)
```
@fig-power-sprocket-cadence-3 shows power losses tend to increase with pedaling cadence, but that this effect is barely
noticeable under common operating conditions.

It is also interesting to note that, once again, rear sprocket size has a much more dramatic effect on power losses (and efficiency)
than front sprocket size. This claim is supported by @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2, where it can be seen that power losses increase significantly
when rear sprocket size is reduced. This means that the dependence of efficiency on rear sprocket size should remain approximately equal, with
the only difference that calculated efficiencies should be lower than before. @fig-efficiency-rear-2 shows calculated efficiencies for a variety
of rear sprocket sizes, keeping front sprocket size at 50 teeth and pedaling cadence at 80 rpm.

@fig-efficiency-rear-2 shows that including the effects of the chain tensioner produced a decrease of about 1.6% in calculated
efficiencies for all rear sprocket sizes, which were mostly over 99% in the original model and are now all under 98%.

As it was mentioned before, one the of the shortcomings observed in the original model is that it predicts that efficiency is
independent of pedaling cadence. Since chain tension is now a function of pedaling cadence and the behaviour of power losses
with respect to this parameter has changes, it is expected that the relationship between efficency and pedaling cadence will be
modified. @fig-efficiency-cadence explores this outcome.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-efficiency-cadence
#| fig-cap: "Efficiency as a function of pedaling cadence"

ω_rpm = 50:150
ω_rad = ω_rpm*(2*pi/60)

η_pc = [ηT(Pin, fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [52, 21, 12, 12], i, γ, m)*100
            for i in ω_rad]

plot(ω_rpm, η_pc, label=false, xlabel="Pedaling cadence [rpm]", ylabel="Efficency [%]")
```

@fig-efficiency-cadence shows that efficiency decreases when pedaling cadence is increased, for a fixed
power input from the cyclist. However, increasing pedaling cadence from 50 to 150 rpm only decreases efficiency
by 0.05%, which does not account for the observed behaviour in experiments.

Another common scenario in cycling is to keep pedaling cadence constant and modify power input. @fig-efficiency-power
shows the change in efficiency as power input is increased, for a constant pedaling cadence of 80 rpm.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-efficiency-power
#| fig-cap: "Efficiency as a function of power input, for a constant pedaling cadence of 80 rpm"

Pplot = 50:350

ηP = [ηT(i, fill(μ, 3), p, ρ, ψ, rR, [52, 21, 12, 12], ω, γ, m)*100 for i in Pplot]

plot(Pplot, ηP, label=false, xlabel="Power input [W]", ylabel="Efficiency [%]")
```

@fig-efficiency-power shows that efficiency increases with load, which is an outcome that could not be observed
in the original model, as stated by one of the authors in @SpicerDeformation. Moreover, this behaviour agrees with
experimental measurements presented in @SpicerFriction and @HighTechCycling. However, it should be noted that increasing
power input from 50 to 350 W only increased efficiency by 0.04%, which is much less than observed in practice.

## Model validation

In order to determine whether the new modifications to the model increased its performance, the new model will also be validated
against experimental data and compared with the original results. @tbl-validation-2 presents these results.

| Pedaling cadence [rpm] | Measured efficiency [%] | Calculated efficiency [%] | Error [%] |
|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------:|:---------:|
| 40 | 97.8 | 97.78 | 0.02 |
| 50 | 95.9 | 97.78 | 2.8 |
| 60 | 94.4 | 97.77 | 3.6 |
| 70 | 92.8 | 97.77 | 5.4 |
| 80 | 91.3 | 97.76 | 7.1 |
| 90 | 89.9 | 97.75 | 8.7 |
: Modified frictional losses model validation {#tbl-validation-2}

A comparison between the results presented in @tbl-validation-2 with those in @tbl-friction-validation shows that the changes
introduced to the model have reduced the experimental error by approximately 2% for all pedaling speeds. However, it is
still observed that error increases with pedaling cadence. This is due to the fact that the predicted decrease in efficiency
as a consequence of increased pedaling cadence is much less than the one observed in practice. In particular, increasing
pedaling cadence from 40 to 90 rpm decreases efficiency by almost 8%, while the model predicts that this decrease is only
0.03%.

# Discussion and Conclusions

An analytical model to calculate a road bicycle's power transmission's system efficiency was developed and implemented
computationally using the Julia programming language, which resulted in the creation of the library [`BicycleEfficiency.jl`](https://github.com/jotas6/BicycleEfficiency.jl).
Although this model was largely obtained from the literature (particularly @SpicerFriction), improvements regarding the
calculation of chain tension as a function of operating conditions and the consideration of the effects of chain tensioners were
proposed in order to improve the model's accuracy.

The analysis performed on the model's outcomes and implications revealed a series of interesting facts about the behaviour of power losses
and efficiency. Particularly, it was shown that efficiency and power losses are much more sensible to changes in rear sprocket
size than front sprocket size. @fig-power-sprocket-cadence and @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2 show that increasing sprocket size reduces
power loss and yields higher efficiencies, which is explained by a decrease in articulation angles, which in turn limits relative motion
between chain pins and bushings during chain articulation. This is related to one of the main outcomes of the model, which indicates that
nearly 90% of power losses come from friction betweeen chain pins and bushings, as it was shown in @fig-power-share and @fig-power-share-2.

Regarding the modifications performed to the original model proposed in @SpicerFriction, it was observed they introduced several changes on the
model's behaviour. In particular, a comparison between @fig-power-sprocket-cadence and @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-2 reveals that the original model predicts a linear
relationship between power losses and pedaling cadence, while the modified version of the model predicts that power losses are almost constant with
respect to pedaling cadence (see also @fig-power-sprocket-cadence-3). Related to this is the behaviour exhibited in @fig-efficiency-cadence and @fig-efficiency-power
where it was shown that efficiency is no longer independent on pedaling cadence and power input (original model). Instead, efficiency increases
with power input and decreases with pedaling cadence, which is in agreement with experimental observations such as the ones found in @HighTechCycling.

Experimental validation of the models show that both models have a tendency to overestimate efficiencies, especially at high pedaling speeds, having an error
of approximately 11% at 90 rpm for the original model. Changes introduced to the model increased its accuracy by nearly 2%, and allow the observation of
the reduction of efficiency at higher pedaling cadences, whereas efficiency is predicted to remain constant in the original model. However, calculated efficiencies
are still higher than their experimental counterparts, and the predicted decrease of efficiency at higher pedaling cadences is much smaller than observed.

Given that predicted efficiencies are higher than observed, even after introducing the adjustments mentioned above, it is reasonable to conclude that there
must be another source of power loss apart from friction. This was also identified in @SpicerFriction, which led to measurements of energy losses using thermal cameras.
Although these measurements are not explicitly included in the article, it is mentioned that energy losses determined with this method
agree with model predictions, which supports the idea that there is another source of energy dissipation.
Works such as @SpicerDeformation and @EffEstimation developed models for energy losses due to elastic deformation and impact.
Future work on this area should focus on incorporating these results into the model and evaluating it's accuracy.
In particular, it would be interesting to evaluate if these new sources of power loss can account for the reduction of
efficiency at higher pedaling cadences, which appears to be the main weak point of the model presented here.
